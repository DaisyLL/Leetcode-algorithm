Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

拿到这个题的时候我有点懵逼，这不是需要循环好多次么 。看了下评论有位答主提到可以当天卖出当天买入，所以就很简单了。只要今天比昨天贵就可以卖出
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            if prices[i-1] <= prices[i]:
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
        return profit
